Growing up in the 90's/ early 2000's I enjoyed playing simple browser games.
I was fond of any game that challenged me to beat my highscore. 
With thoughts flowing back I had the idea of what I wanted to create, something simple and fun.

The players current highscore and current score are displayed in the top right hand corner of the browser. 
Instructions: 

Object of the game is jump over the obstacles and try to beat your highscore!

- Controls - Press Space bar to Jump!

- To restart the game click the restart button when prompted!



-- The game is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript --

Bugs: 
The game will start when the browser opens automatically setting user highscore. 
The jump sound will continue after the game has ended when pressing spacebar.
